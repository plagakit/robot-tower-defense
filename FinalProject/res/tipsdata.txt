Welcome to Robot Tower Defense, made by Thomas P. To start, buy a Robot tower from the shop on your right and place it anywhere near the track. Then, hit the play button. (BTW, this is a tip. click to make it disappear, or turn them off in settings!)
Towers will attack any bloon within their range. To see their range, click on them! When you click on them, you can also purchase upgrades on the right.
Bloons are similar to nesting dolls. Red bloons are the weakest type of bloons, and pop easily. Blue bloons, when popped, release a red bloon!
Money is rewarded when you pop a bloon, and also at the end of a round. You can choose to spend money on new towers, or to save it up for an expensive upgrade!
When popped, green bloons release one blue bloon. It would take 3 pops in total to completely pop a green bloon!
If you don't like clicking the play button every time a round finishes, you can turn on auto start in the settings.
Bloons will always move towards the end of the track. When they reach the end, they take one life for every red bloon in them. Don't let your lives drop to 0!
The Scissor Robot tower always throws scissors that curve either to the left or the right. It can pop many bloons at once, but it needs proper positioning.
It might get really loud in later rounds when many bloons are popped at once. You can always go to settings to adjust the volume.
The next level of bloons is here: yellow bloons! They are speedy, and release 2 green bloons when popped.

There are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. As the difficulty increases, prices and bloon speed increase, but lives and money rewarded at the end of the round decrease.

A new type of bloon: pink bloons! They are very fast, and release 2 yellows.

The Flamethrower Robot has have a short range, but is powerful at popping groups of bloons. Consider placing one in tight areas where it can cover a lot of track.

The fast-forward button can be used to fast-forward the game. Useful for pro gamers who already know what they're doing.


New bloons incoming: black bloons and white bloons! They are small but deadly, and release 2 pinks when popped.

Bloons only pop when projectiles actually hit them. Even when a robot's aim is perfect, a slow moving projectile might miss a fast bloon!

Upgrades have two branches and two stages. When you upgrade one branch to its max upgrade, the other branch's max upgrade becomes locked. Choose your max upgrade wisely!

A new type of bloon approaches... the zebra bloon! A mixture of black and white, they release a black bloon and a white bloon upon pop.

Playing this game is fun, but remember to take a break and go outside every once in a while, then come back once you want to play again!

In the original BTD series, the towers that pop bloons were monkeys! Robots are much cooler though...

# 31-40
#
Rainbow bloons! They're colourful, fast, and release two zebra bloons when popped. Make sure to pop them before they speed through the track.


Speed round!

Ceramic bloons are two rainbow bloons encased in a hard and brittle ceramic. They take a few hits to fully pop.



Incoming... the Mother Of All Bloons (also known as MOAB). This giant bloon is slow but tanky, and releases 4 ceramic bloons when burst. It has a lot of health, so it will take a while to pop it.

The final ten rounds are much harder than the previous ones. Can you beat them?





If you have played the game this project is based on, BTD6, then you might know about its infamous "round 68", where tight packs of ceramic bloons easily blow through your defenses. Why bring this up right before the next round? Who knows...
The end is near...
The final round... good luck!
